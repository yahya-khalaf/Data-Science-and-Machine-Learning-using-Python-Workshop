    "Our recommendation model relies on cosine similarity between movie titles. This approach assumes that users will enjoy movies with similar titles to those they have already rated highly. In this evaluation, we'll review the process and suggest ways to improve the model's performance.\n",

    "    Precision and Recall: These metrics measure how many of the recommended movies are relevant to the user (precision) and how many relevant movies are being recommended (recall).\n",
    "    F1 Score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.\n",
    "    Mean Average Precision (MAP): This evaluates how well the system ranks the relevant items at t\n",
    "\n",
    "    he top of the list.\n",
    "    Hit Rate: Measures the number of recommended items that the user interacts with.\n",
    "    Coverage: Measures the proportion of items from the entire dataset that the recommendation system covers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using cosine similarity for the recommendations, the next step would be to collect user feedback or interaction data to apply these metrics.\n",
