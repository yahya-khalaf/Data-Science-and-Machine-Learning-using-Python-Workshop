# Data Science and Machine Learning using Python Workshop

Welcome to the **Data Science and Machine Learning using Python Workshop** repository! This repository contains all the course materials, including Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and resources, to help you learn and practice data science and machine learning concepts using Python.

---

## **Course Overview**
This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** using Python. The course is divided into two main sections:

1. **Python for Data Science**: Covers foundational topics like data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
2. **Machine Learning using Python**: Focuses on machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and advanced techniques like clustering and recommender systems.

Each topic is accompanied by a hands-on lab in the form of a Jupyter notebook, along with relevant datasets for practice.
